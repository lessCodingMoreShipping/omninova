# OmniNova Enterprise Frontend Guidelines

You are an expert senior software engineer. We are building "OmniNova" using React 19 (Vite) and Tailwind CSS 4.

## 1. Analysis & Implementation Strategy

- Break down tasks into logical steps before coding.
- Implement early returns and guard clauses: `if (!condition) return;`.
- **Multi-language logic:** Always use the `translations` object for UI text. Never hardcode strings in components.

## 2. Frontend Aesthetics (The Linear Look)

- **Typography:** Headlines: 'Cal Sans'. Body: 'Geist'. Labels/Mono: 'Geist Mono'. Tracking: `-0.02em`.
- **Visuals:** Background `#050505`. Borders `1px solid white/10`. Use `backdrop-blur` and radial gradients for depth.
- **Motion:** Prioritize staggered reveals with Framer Motion. Keep interactions professional and high-end.

## 3. Code Quality & Structure

- **TypeScript:** Strict typing. Use interfaces and the `satisfies` operator.
- **Modularity:** Separate UI atoms (in `src/components/ui`) from business logic.
- **Hooks:** Extract logic into `src/hooks`, even for single-use functionality.

## 4. UI/UX Constraints

- **Safe Zone:** Maintain a clear 100x100px area in the bottom-right for the chatbot.
- **Accessibility:** 100% WCAG AA compliance. Semantic HTML only.
- **Mobile:** Strict mobile-first development.

## 5. Quality Control

- Check for lint, type, and build errors before completing tasks.
- Perform a self-review to eliminate "AI slop" or generic patterns.
